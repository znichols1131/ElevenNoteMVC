# Eleven Note MVC

Author: Zach Nichols

Assignment: The **Eleven Fifty Academy Eleven Note MVC** app encourages students to revisit the Eleven Note API project from Blue Badge and reconstruct it as an MVC app. The following classes were required to have data models, controllers, and views for creation, viewing details, updating, and deletion:

- `Note` contains a unique ID, title, content, category, date of creation, and date of modification (if any). A boolean value (IsStarred) keeps track of the importance of the Note, which can be seen on the Index view as a star icon.

- `Category` contains a unique ID, title, description, and list of associated Notes. The Category list is sorted by title.
